> ## This repository has moved to [the go monorepo: https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon). Please direct any future Pull Requests there.

Horizon is the [client facing API](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/services/horizon/docs) server for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between stellar-core and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Stellar ecosystem](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/) for more details.
